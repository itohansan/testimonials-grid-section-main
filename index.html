                I&apos;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
                free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
                I&apos;ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software

              ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code.
              I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
              programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
              program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
              were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
              The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
              learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
              have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an
              example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
              job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
              100% recommend! ‚Äù
